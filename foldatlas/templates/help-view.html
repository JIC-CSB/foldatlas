<h2>Genome browser</h2>
<p>
    FoldAtlas includes a genome browser called <i>d3nome</i>, which shows intron and exon boundaries for each transcript, along with features that are near to the transcript of interest. This facilitates genome exploration and identification of interesting transcripts.

<h2>Searching for transcripts</h2>
<h3>Go to a known transcript ID</h3>
<p>
    To search for a known transcript identifier (e.g. the TAIR identifier "AT1G01010.1"), hit <b>Search</b> in the title bar, followed by the <b>Transcript ID</b> tab. Next, the transcript transcript ID should be entered and the <b>Search</b> button pressed. This will search the FoldAtlas database and jump to the profile page of the first match.
</p>
<img class="help-example-image" src="{{ settings.static_base_url }}/assets/help/search-transcript-id.png" />

<h3>Find high coverage transcripts</h3>
<p>
    An issue with genome-scale RNA structure probing experiments is that many transcripts have only a small number of reads mapped to them, i.e. are low-coverage. We have produced an interface that lists transcripts in order of coverage. This can be reached by pressing <b>Search</b> and then choosing the <b>Coverage</b> tab. Transcripts with the best coverage are listed first, so that high-coverage transcripts can be found easily. The right column indicates transcripts where <i>in vivo</i> structures are available.
</p>
<img class="help-example-image" src="{{ settings.static_base_url }}/assets/help/search-coverage.png" />

<h2>Structure views</h2>
<p>
    FoldAtlas holds RNA secondary structure predictions generated using the RNAstructure package [REF]. Predictions are divided into two categories: <i>in vivo</i>, and <i>in silico</i>. Each structure prediction has an estimated free energy term associated, in kcal/mol.

<h3><i>In silico</i> predictions</h3>
<p>
    All transcript sequences have <i>in silico</i> structures, which have been generated from the RNA sequence alone, without constraints.
</p> 

<h3><i>In vivo</i> predictions</h3>
<p>
    The <i>in vivo</i> structures have been generated by constraining the prediction method with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) reactivity values, generated in a previous genome-scale screen [REF]. Constraining predictions using experimental structure probing data has been shown to improve the predictive accuracy [REF], hence <i>in vivo</i> predictions are inferred to be of better accuracy than their <i>in silico</i> counterparts.
</p><p>
    It is important to note that not all transcripts have <i>in vivo</i> predictions, since many transcripts have low read sequence coverage, corresponding to low RNA abundance. The proportion of transcripts with <i>in vivo</i> predictions will improve in future FoldAtlas iterations, as read depth from experiments increases.
<p>

<h3>PCA plots for structural similarity visualisation</h3>
<img class="help-example-image-small" src="{{ settings.static_base_url }}/assets/help/pca.png" />
<p>
    When the RNAstructure prediction method is run on a transcript sequence, up to 20 low free energy structures are generated. In FoldAtlas, the similarity between these structures is visualised using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Each dot on the plot is a structure, and similar structures are located in close proximity to one another.
</p><p>
    Clicking a dot shows detailed information about the structure. A red dot colour indicates lower free energy, i.e. a more favourable structure. The minimum free energy (MFE) structure is visualised by default.
</p><p>
    The method for using PCA with RNA structures has been described in an earlier work [REF], and involves generating a vector of length <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of nucleotides. The value at each position in the vector is set to either 0 if the corresponding base is unpaired, or 1 if paired. The vectors are then entered into the PCA method [REF], with each vector position as a dimension.
</p>

<h3>Circle plots for base pairing visualisation</h3>
<img class="help-example-image-small" src="{{ settings.static_base_url }}/assets/help/circle.png" />
<p>
    The circle plot can be used to intuitively visualise base pairing in a predicted RNA structure [REF]. Bases are arranged in a circle according to their sequence position, and lines drawn between bases indicate pairing. The free energy estimate is displayed in the top right corner.
</p>

<h3>Structure diagrams for fold visualisation</h3>
<img class="help-example-image-small" src="{{ settings.static_base_url }}/assets/help/structure-diagram.png" />
<p>
    FoldAtlas also visualises structures using a fold diagram. The diagram is generated using the <i>ViennaRNA</i>[REF] package and then displayed in the browser using the <i>forna</i>[REF] JS module. Clicking </b>Enable interaction</b> allows the structure diagram to be rearranged by clicking and dragging bases. A free energy estimate is displayed in the top right corner.
</p><p>
    The nucleotides are coloured according to their reactivity. Green nucleotides represent weak or no reactivity, orange denotes moderate reactivity, whilst red indicates strong reactivity. White nucleotides indicate that reactivity is irrelevant. G and U nucleotides are always coloured white because we are displaying DMS reactivity data, and DMS only reacts with unpaired C and A nucleotides.
</p>

<h3>Structural entities</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Structure prediction run:</b>
            This represents a single genome-scale RNA structure prediction run. At present all of these have been generated using the RNAstructure [REF] method.
        </li><li>
            <b>Structure:</b>
            Represents a single structure that has been predicted as part of a structure prediction run. This is generated from a single transcript sequence. Includes a free energy estimate and data for PCA plots.
        </li><li>
            <b>Structure position:</b>
            Stores the base pairing attributes of a single nucleotide position within a structure prediction. The base pairing information can be used to plot RNA structure diagrams.
        </li><li>
            <b>Nucleotide experiment:</b>
            Represents a genome-scale experiment that involves taking measurements at specific nucleotide positions. At present this is used to represent DMS reactivity data. In the future, data from SHAPE and ribosome profiling experiments will also be represented by this entity.
        </li><li>
            <b>Nucleotide measurement Set:</b>
            Represents a set of DMS measurements for a single transcript. Includes a property to store a per-nucleotide coverage value for the entire transcript.
        </li><li>
            <b>Nucleotide measurement:</b>
            Represents a single DMS reactivity measurement, at a specific nucleotide position.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Genomic entities</h3>

<p>
    Other FoldAtlas tables deal with representing genomic data structures. These are used by the genome browser and also to generate RNA sequences. These cover gene and transcript identifiers. Genomic entities include:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Strain:</b>
            A strain represents a single sequenced accession of a particular organism. At present, the only strain stored in FoldAtlas is Col0, which represents the <i>A. thaliana</i> reference genome. Future versions of FoldAtlas will include additional strains and organisms.
        </li><li>
            <b>Chromosome:</b>
            All FoldAtlas sequences originate from chromosome entities. Each chromosome is associated with a strain and a chromosome ID, which is a generic identifier shared across strains. The sequence property stores the entire chromosome sequence.
        </li><li>
            <b>Feature:</b>
            A feature describes start and stop boundaries within a chromosome that correspond to coding sequences (CDSs), untranslated regions (UTRs) or introns. By combining  features and chromosome sequences, it is possible to find the sequence of a transcript.
        </li><li>
            <b>Gene Location:</b>
            A gene location contains redundant information about the start and stop boundaries of a gene with respect to the genome sequence of a particular strain. This data is used to quickly calculate gene lengths, and to visualise gene boundaries in the integrated <i>d3nome</i> genome browser.
        </li><li>
            <b>Gene:</b>
            FoltAtlas gene entities are generic, i.e. are shared between different strains. A gene can therefore have multiple strain-specific locations, and can also be associated with multiple transcripts, representing alternative splice forms.
        </li><li>
            <b>Transcript:</b>
            The transcript is a generic entity that can be shared amongst multiple strains, with the transcript sequence represented by chromosome sequence and strain-specific features that cover the chromosome sequence.
        </li>
    </ol>
